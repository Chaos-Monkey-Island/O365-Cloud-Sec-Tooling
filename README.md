# O365-Cloud-Sec-Tooling
A collection of useful PowerShell scripts to demonstrate interacting with various customer facing features via the Graph API,
such as Secure Score.

## Disclaimer
The Secure Score is a numerical summary of your security posture within Office 365 based on system configurations, user behavior and other security related measurements; it is not an absolute measurement of how likely your system or data will be breached; rather, it represents the extent to which you have adopted security controls available in Office 365 which can help offset the risk of being breached. No online service is completely immune from security breaches; the Secure Score should not be interpreted as a guarantee against security breach in any manner.
